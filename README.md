Flickr GEO Fetcher
==================

Need a lot of geo-tagged images from all around the world? This stupid little python script gives you the amount you need by fetching them from flickr.

First, install flickrapi:

    pip install flickrapi

Put your flickr api credentials into `credentials.py`

    api_key = u'YOUR_API_KEY'
    api_secret = u'YOUR_API_SECRET'
    
Finally, run that bastard:

    ./fgf.py

Now sit back and relax while pix are flying in. This may take a looot of time ;-)
